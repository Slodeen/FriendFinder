# FriendFinder
This app matches your scores to other users and link  you to other users

In this project, I have used node modules, json packages with combination of javascript.  
Below are some information on how to use this application:

1: You need to go through each question
2: Answer each question thoroughly scoring 1 to be the least and 5 to be the most
3: Also, you need to upload the link of your picture on the survey page
4: Once submitted, you will be prompt with another user's profile that best matches your profile.
